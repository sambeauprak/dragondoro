**Dragondoro** is an intrusive **Pomodoro Timer** for Windows, built using Flutter. It forces you to stay productive by locking your session when the focus timer ends and ensuring you return to work after breaks through subtle, yet effective, notifications like **keyboard tap sounds** and **desktop notifications**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Break Alerts**: Plays a realistic keyboard typing sound and sends desktop notifications when breaks are over.
- **Windows-Only**: Optimized for **Windows** systems.
- **Flutter-Based**: Built with the power of **Flutter**, ensuring smooth performance.
- **Minimal UI**: Clean and functional interface for easy timer control.
- **Coming Soon**:
